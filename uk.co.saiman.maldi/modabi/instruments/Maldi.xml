Instrument definition specified exactly:
- miniature replication of service registry inside instrument definition, complex
- experiments associated with a specific instrument, and retrieve hardware components from it

Instrument definition implied via loosely coupled services: 
- How to deal with duplicate hardware services? (sometimes intended!)
	= Have experiment parts configurable with which hardware component versions they're associated with
- Can only feasibly have one instrument operational at a time within a framework.
	= Is this really a problem?
	= Following from solution to above problem, we can have multiple experiment type
	  copies, so it's really only one instrument per experiment manager.
- Further to above, can only easily have one instrument lifecycle.
	= Associate instrument lifecycle with an experiment manager? How to sync?
